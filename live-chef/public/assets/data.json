    "description": "Indulge in Chef André's signature Charcoal-Seared Ribeye, a masterpiece of culinary art. This prime cut of aged beef is marinated with a delicate blend of garlic, rosemary, and cracked black pepper, then seared over an open flame to achieve a perfect crust. Cooked to your desired doneness, the steak is served with a drizzle of smoky bourbon glaze and a side of roasted garlic mashed potatoes. Each bite promises a symphony of flavor—succulent, tender, and irresistibly savory.",
